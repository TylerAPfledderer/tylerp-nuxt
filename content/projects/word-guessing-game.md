title: Word Guessing Game
description: "(Desktop Only) A hangman-style game. This project was used to
  build in 4 different JavaScript versions: Vanilla, Classes, Vue, and React.
  The Vue version implements Vuex store to pass state for letters selected and
  displayed on the random phrase (if correct) and the ability to do a full reset
  after the end of a game."
