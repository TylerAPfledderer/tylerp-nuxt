title: Desktop Weather App
description: A desktop-only app built in React. Uses the Context API to pass
  data between each route. Includes the use of the Geolocation and Big Data
  Cloud Reverse Geo APIs, and the OneCall OpenWeather API to get all data
  necessary for hourly and daily forecasts. Custom hooks are used to retrieve
  the Geolocation and format the forecast data for better visual display.
